------------------------------------------------

Where did we leave off?

- We successfully set up a new seperate docs.ef.com git repo


- We need to pick back up: use the Elegant docs package to bootstrap the docs site code

------------------------------------------------

- Figure out how to use Elegant Docs to bootstrap the docs site  ~~~ Document it all :)3


- Set up brandon@elegantframework.com email addess ... Use that for people to contact us

- Use a fractal as a logo... Have a logo created

- Add changelog to the docs site


- Set up an old school "under construction" page ASAP for the main site using our own tech




- Add a doc guide on how to set up seperate sites, but connect them as one.. Ex: ***.com docs.**.com blog.abc.com 


- Set up another seperate brandonowens.com website using our tech as a playground and show n tell ---> SHOW HN: I made an old school under construction page


- Blog about everything when we can blog, and when we have something to blog about

- Update our code standards from tailwinds in the contribution guide
